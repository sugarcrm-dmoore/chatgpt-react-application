Titile: Cases assigned to incorrect user + Account name changes: logic hook?
 Description: Hello team, 
 
We’ve run into an issue with our cases being assigned to the wrong user. This appears to be done by a logic hook and corresponds to a whole series of changes being made to the Account Name of the case. It’s a bit strange! 
Please see the screenshot below on case 100575 <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/index.php*Cases/8a5aee0c-a973-11ed-a428-026aa914312c__;Iw!!P-5o2buULA!yK9Z-SeC6_jf3jTBAypQ63AxoUoW55UcCW7GNB2T1WIV05i7eTP_xhRaxXR_pU9CbTW8JG2b3phc0WXrDzHdHbOifCVuLgI$>.
 
In fact, we also reached out to Joakim who have checked it from his side and seems like the logic hook doesn`t do anything.
 
Do you have any suggestions as to what might be going wrong here?
 
Thank you,
 

 
 
 
Best regards,
 
Daria

Titile: Sync event data from event module in Sugar Sell to Sugar Market
 Description: Hi Support,

We are currently investigating alternative webinar platform – ON24 and plan to build integration from ON24 to Sugar CRM, problem is that I do want the webinars in ON24 to be associated with an event in Sugar Market – for lead scoring purposes, can this be achieved if the webinar data is mapped from ON24 to Sugar CRM and then Sugar CRM sync the event data to Sugar Market (including creating the event and also adding all registrants and attendees)?

Thanks for your insights.
Best regards,

Huan

Titile: External form connector - Sugar Market
 Description: Hi Sugar support,

 

I see the external form connector is under Legacy feature now, may I ask whether this feature is still fully usable and will it be phased out this year or 2024? We need this feature to connect our website form (with custom fields) to sugar market form for lead scoring and lead management.

As we are contracting an agency to do this, we need  your response ASAP.

 

Many thanks!
