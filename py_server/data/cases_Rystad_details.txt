Titile: Cases assigned to incorrect user + Account name changes: logic hook?
 Description: Hello team, 
 
We’ve run into an issue with our cases being assigned to the wrong user. This appears to be done by a logic hook and corresponds to a whole series of changes being made to the Account Name of the case. It’s a bit strange! 
Please see the screenshot below on case 100575 <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/index.php*Cases/8a5aee0c-a973-11ed-a428-026aa914312c__;Iw!!P-5o2buULA!yK9Z-SeC6_jf3jTBAypQ63AxoUoW55UcCW7GNB2T1WIV05i7eTP_xhRaxXR_pU9CbTW8JG2b3phc0WXrDzHdHbOifCVuLgI$>.
 
In fact, we also reached out to Joakim who have checked it from his side and seems like the logic hook doesn`t do anything.
 
Do you have any suggestions as to what might be going wrong here?
 
Thank you,
 

 
 
 
Best regards,
 
Daria

Titile: Sync event data from event module in Sugar Sell to Sugar Market
 Description: Hi Support,

We are currently investigating alternative webinar platform – ON24 and plan to build integration from ON24 to Sugar CRM, problem is that I do want the webinars in ON24 to be associated with an event in Sugar Market – for lead scoring purposes, can this be achieved if the webinar data is mapped from ON24 to Sugar CRM and then Sugar CRM sync the event data to Sugar Market (including creating the event and also adding all registrants and attendees)?

Thanks for your insights.
Best regards,

I try to uncheck the domain level box but couldn’t, don’t know what the error message means as there is no domains in the list but email addresses


1. Should I uncheck the box of Email Suppression and add the suppression list in the email recipient step? So people can still receive other emails than the newsletter?


After I doing that, I couldn’t find the list under the suppression list, did I do something wrong?

I am reaching out because since several months ago I haven't been able to sync my meetings in Microsoft Outlook to SugarCRM. I try syncing the meetings, but they just don’t appear on Sugar. Further, I have tried reinstalling the sugar CRM plugin and downloading the latest version of SugarCRM but that didn't work.

 

Rystad’s IT team has reached out to you asking for advice on how to solve this, but they haven’t heard from you.

 

Could you please advise what else to do in this case? In this instance, I could suggest a video call to show you the problem (also described above) so you can also do trouble shooting of the system. Please let me know if any of your support staff is available today.

 

Many thanks and look forward to hearing from you.

 Description: Hi Sugar support,

 

I reported this issue before but you said that the change was done so long time ago that you can’t trace it and investigate the reason, now I find some more recent examples whose assigned user changed and also Account name changed for no reason, at least I know I didn’t manually make the changes. I suspect there are some errors with the sync between sugar market and sugar crm.

 

Please look into the issue asap. Thanks.

Titile: Possibe to lock a lead or contact record?
 Description: Hi Support,

 

Some of our BDs manually update contact and lead records with more accurate information they get. However, with the sync between sugar market and sugar crm, especially form submission data, the changes can be overwritten (industry, title, phone number etc), is there any possibility that we lock certain records in crm that forbids any changes via the sync? In most of the cases, we do want the fields to be updated by form submission data.

 

It is helpful to have info mapped to the Event Management section for leads and contacts, but is it possible to pull a report including high level data of how many people registered or attended a certain webinar belonging to a certain account?

 

Thanks,

Huan

Titile: FW: Date of Next Renewal field issues
 Description: Hello Sugar support team,

 

Would you be able to suggest why the Date of Next Renewal field for our accounts no longer seems to be working, please?



 

Based on in put from Excitec, it seems to collects all RLI related to the Account where the RLI have Product Type = Existing Business, Renewable = 1. From the result it will pick the first Expected Close Date from the RLI and add to the Account (see snip below). This does’t seem to make sense however, as the Expected Close Date on RLI that are Won or Lost will be in the past. It should probably only pick up those that are still open. Would you be able to advise how we can get this field working again, please?

 

Thank you in advance!

 

Best regards,

Tyler

Subject: Re: Date of Next Renewal field issues

 

Hi Tyler

I looked into the logic of this and I have to say that it doesn't make any sense to me. So I believe this is a question for SugarCRM's support to answer.

 

The current logic that sets the Date of Next Renewal is as follows:

When a RLI is saved it will run a function that collects all RLI related to the Account where the RLI have Product Type = Existing Business, Renewable = 1. From the result it will pick the first Expected Close Date from the RLI and add to the Account.

 

For me it doesn't make any sense as the Expected Close Date on RLI that are Won or Lost will be in the past. It should probably only pick up those that are still open.

 

I created a report where it lists all the RLI on Wintershell Dea . There you can see the Expected Close Date on all RLI, and the lowest value is 30th of June 2021, which is the value that is added to the account. https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Reports/5608bc24-34ca-11ed-bb85-025ca28137ba

 

Do you want me to contact SugarCRM's support regarding this or will you do it yourself?

 

Vänligen,

Hello Joakim,

 

Would you be able to suggest why the Date of Next Renewal field for our accounts no longer seems to be working, please? Wintershall Dea is one such example; Schlumberger is another. Cannot seem to figure it out.

We have identified a bug.
 
1. Summation reports (ie charts) are using the locked exchange rate at the time of close won on the revenue line items

2. Rows and columns reports are using the live current exchange rate – not the locked exchange rate at time of close won.
 
Point 2 is a bug as both reports should always use the locked exchange rate at the time of close. This was fixed for Summitation reports in 11.1 but I think the bug has reemerged with rows and columns. Ref: https://portal.sugarondemand.com/#supp_Bugs/86470

Titile: Including deleted record in API response
 Description: Good morning Sugar team,

I’m currently running a query to our internal Sugar database (created using the Sugar API) that takes the sum of RLIs and groups them by opportunity. However, I noticed I’m including many RLIs that are associated with opportunities that no longer exist in the Sugar UI (ie. when I run a report there). Two such opportunities are '47803272-82b9-11ec-b117-0af44246ff10' and '1e14d40a-267b-11ec-b105-025ca28137ba'. In our internal Sugar database, both of these records are marked as not deleted (deleted=0).
 
When I raised this issue with our tech team, they stated:
Those deleted records are actually not being included into the response of Sugar API call (means, all records in the result have deleted=0). So, we simply do not synchronize deleted data, as it is now. This call type (exsFetchTable API method) is a custom one they created especially for our need. The solution would be to ask Sugar to include deleted records to the response.
 
Would it be possible to include these deleted records in the API response, please?
 
Let me know if there’s any further information you require here or if there is anything you would like to discuss.
 
Best regards,
Tyler

I'm opening a new case here raise the priority to 1 as this issue is bringing our support team to a halt.  Please see the response below from our consultant who has investigated the cause of the case delay:

****************
Hi Tyler
I have investigated today, but as I do not have access to the server to actually see what is going on my work is very limited.

When BPM is running it is queued up in a table called job_queues. Sugar is then processing this queue. If there are some jobs that take a long time it can cause other processes to stall or not execute at all. I had a look at the job_queue and I can see that there are a lot of jobs that has failed.

But interesting is that you have a scheduler that runs at 5:00 every morning that should clean the job_queue of the processes that are more than 30 days old. From what I can see last time it ran was 13th of June, and there are over 375.000 !!! records in that table which in itself can cause latency. It can also be related to missing indexes in databases or even mail server issues, big attachments causing delay, etc.

The only way of getting to the bottom of this is to have SugarCRM Support looking into it as they have full access to trace why you have these latency issues.

I recommend you to again contact support with a priority 1 case.

Please ask them to look into why the job_queue is not being cleaned up with the scheduler: https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#bwc/index.php?module=Schedulers&offset=16&stamp=1656684842067606200&return_module=Schedulers&action=DetailView&record=694e993f-7cdd-17f0-891e-53b3c66b78b0

If Sugars Support say it has to do with customizations they will have to tell us how they came to that conclusion.
****************

Would you please be able to look into why the job_queue is not being cleaned up with the scheduler: https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#bwc/index.php?module=Schedulers&offset=16&stamp=1656684842067606200&return_module=Schedulers&action=DetailView&record=694e993f-7cdd-17f0-891e-53b3c66b78b0

If this have something to do with our customizations, please provide some additional context as to why that may be the case.

Best regards,
Tyler

Titile: Recipient list errors
 Description: Hi Support,

 

I recently noticed that some reports give errors when trying to add them to the recipient list under Email module. I know the solution is to add contactID field in the report but is it possible that I do a mass update of all the concerning reports and add contactID field in one go instead of the back and forth when I try to use a report? Thanks!

 Description: Hello there

 

We have built 2 Microsoft form surveys to email our database.

 

I have been trying, quite unsuccessfully, to embed the form into the email using the Sugar code feature.

 

As you can see, it does not work very well: https://appeu.salesfusion.com/webapp/#/email-builder/single-email/build/drag-drop/1525

 

The iframe is not responsive to the size of the email, so you are scrolling to see the survey within a box.

 

We really want to embed this survey and have it formatted properly to we have the optimum take-up of this (I don`t want to redirect to the survey form).

 

Can you help us ASAP? The survey is due to be distributed early July.

 

Thanks

Hi Tyler,

 

Sugar looks to be doing it again to where it’s not syncing properly and cases are taking anywhere between 30+ minutes to appear, sometimes not showing up at all.

 

We’ve sent a couple test emails to support and have yet to appear.  If you can please look into this again and advise us as soon as you can.

There was an issue recently (Sugar Market #455010) with some email addresses bounced due to email deliveries and set as 'Invalid' for leads and contacts in SugarCRM as per example: https://www.screencast.com/t/XjGW7uDJ0DyH
Could you please revert the email status to valid? Unfortunately I am not able to sync the status from Sugar Market so I hope you have a way to update them in bulk.
The below emails are affected:
All email addresses from @cenovus.com domain

And the below addresses:

Titile: Valid contact marked as invalid - Sugar Sell
 Description: Hi Support,

 

My colleagues reported that they’ve received over a 100 auto notifications indicating that certain emails are no longer valid in Sugar (a large number of them being Cenovus).

 

For example: rhona.delfrari@cenovus.com

 

This person is still subscribed to our emails and opened our email on May 9 in Sugar Market. It says that there is a routing error when the person is marked as invalid, could you please investigate whether there is something wrong with the system? I’m concerned with the large number of notifications that we’ve received lately that valid email addresses might be mistakenly included.

 

 

 

Example below:

From: SugarCRM <sugarcrm@rystadenergy.com>
Sent: Thursday, May 19, 2022 3:38 PM
To: Jason MacVicar <jason.macvicar@rystadenergy.com>
Cc: Therese Fuglerud <therese.fuglerud@rystadenergy.com>
Subject: Invalid email: rhona.delfrari@cenovus.com

 

Hi 

 

The email address of a contact you are assigned to has just been marked as "Invalid".

First name: Rhona

Last name: DelFrari

Account name: Cenovus Energy Inc. (Calgary, CA)

Delivery message: routing-errors

Rhona DelFrari

This can happen if an email address was entered incorrectly or if this person has left the organization and the email address has bounced.

Previous contacts / users can be a good source of new leads - so please reach out on LinkedIn. 

We will no longer email this person in Sugar Market as repeated bounces can affect our sender reputation.

Thanks,

Rystad Energy Sales Team

When I save the opportunity it reverts back to 24/05/22

Titile: Nurture 2.0 slow trigger action
 Description: Hi Support,

 

To suppress competitors from downloading our whitepapers, we add a Nurture 2.0 with an email including the whitepaper pdf link to our whitepaper download forms. Example: form ID 451

 

The problem now is that it takes too long for a person to get the triggered email after submitting the form - sometimes it’s 20 minutes, sometimes it is over an hour, and this is especially unstable for our team members in China. We are happy to do tests with you to see the reason for this delay.

But the slow processing time is detrimental to our customer relationship and branding.

 

Please look into it and prioritize the speedup of the processing time of emails in Nurture 2.0. Please respond to both me and my collageue Yuan Xia Yuan.Xia@rystadenergy.com. Thanks!

 Description: Hi Support,

 

We are thinking of updating a drop-down field called “industry” in all our forms and form templates. I assume many of us have cookies in the forms, so info is pre-filled even it is a new form. I am wondering, will it be possible that after I edited the drop-down list, people can still submit forms with old information?

 

For example, now when I open a form, the “industry” field is pre-filled, what if I update the form and there wont be a banking value in the drop down list? Will I still be able to submit the form or I will be forced to choose Industry as the old value is not existent anymore? We’d like people to select industry from the new drop down list, please let me know how I can achieve this. Many thanks!

If no meeting then a task is created to schedule a call. I am very sure this has no impact on the case email problem.

If we can set up another call to troubleshoot the issue, that would be appreciated. I am available most times this week in the afternoon CET.

Thanks in advance for your assistance here.

Original Case
We are having a huge delay between when cases are sent to our support folder, with the corresponding case attached, and it does not show up in sugar. It will either take hours and hours to show up or not at all. We are also seeing this when clients send cases to the support email and it does not register in sugar. Please see the attachment for an example.

I see this happening pretty frequently the closer we get to 5PM CT. It usually starts acting up around 4PM CT and by 5PM, I will not see cases update at all for hours (or not at all).

I am based in Houston, TX, USA.

Quick question, for a nurture that I set as live, after I swap an email in the nurture, are the stats related to the previous email saved somewhere?

 

I am using the Nurture 2.0 for running our monthly newsletter automations (those who sign up after a current issue is published will get the newest edition through the nurture), but each month I will need to swap out the newsletter included in the nurture yet I don’t want to lose the sats (sends, opens and clicks). Where should I look for the stats?

Titile: Marking of accounts that have been modified
 Description: Hello Sugar team,

 

Is a method for filtering accounts that have undergone changes within a given time period, similar to what is available for contacts?

 

To provide some context, we have a script running that synchronizes changes to contacts in Sugar with another database we are hosting internally. This script synchronises all contacts that have been modified since the last time it ran. However, we’ve noticed that changes to the account with which the contacts are associated does not mark these contacts as having changed. As such, we would like to include in our script a method to check for changes to any accounts, then update contacts associated with these accounts. See correspondence with our tech team below for additional context, but feel free to reach out with any questions you may have.

 

Thanks in advance for your assistance here!

Tyler

https://appeu.salesfusion.com/Dashboards.aspx#/dash/email/605

Why for this one “unique” click can go above 100%

 

Also this one

https://appeu.salesfusion.com/Dashboards.aspx#/dash/email/582

 

And why did my email for February covid webinar invite disappear? I attach the invite with this email. I can’t find them with a search in the email dashboard.

 

Thanks for your investigation

 

Best regards,

Huan

Titile: [Re-open Case:440362] Duplicate leads created in sugar crm
 Description: [Please describe why this case is being re-opened]

Thank you for the explanation, as you mentioned "The duplicate checks occur only when converting the lead, so when the leads were created, the email was not checked to see if there was an existing lead." What do you mean when say "The duplicate checks occur only when converting the lead". We have our form submission with lead sync activated in sugar market, does this mean that a person with an existing lead account created in sugar crm can still get a new lead record created with a sugar form submission? Is this always the case?

 Description: Hi Support,

 

Example report: https://appeu.salesfusion.com/Reporting/Editor/ReportEditor.aspx?ReportId=138

 

Email duplicates found as they have different account names. It seems that when a lead conveyed to a contact the field info is not updated at the backend.



Example: akira.mizobe@inpex.co.jp

https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Contacts/7d081e54-7af0-11eb-a0d3-02fdc066b29e

https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Leads/54c988a4-a0e5-11eb-b978-02fdc066b29e

 

In Sugar Sell, the lead’s account name is updated to the contact’s one but not in the sugar market report, it would be great if this info is updated, synced and mapped precisely so we can avoid creating duplicates in the report.

 

Thanks.

Titile: Amazon Connect disconnects automatically with Sugar Live
 Description: Dear team,

 

We’re using Amazon Connect with Sugar Live. After implementing Amazon Connect for our offices in the US and the UK, we have experienced an issue which seems to consistently occurring across the board – once an agent is logged in, the green colour indicating that it’s logged in keeps shading out and the agent has to go back on turn it on again. Our agents have reported that every 30 minute or so they have to manually turn it back on. If they don’t, the calls don’t come through.

 

I spoke to Amazon about the issue and they said that the standard login time is 10 hours so my question is if this is something related to Sugar Live? Hope you can look into this, as you can imagine we need to get this fixed.

 Description: Hi Support,

We encountered a weird case today, the contact record is GONE and the lead record was created at 7-13-2021 at 8:37am for the person.

Here is his lead record but again he has been a contact record for over 2years!

https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/index.php#Leads/71b8de0a-e3df-11eb-be33-068897b1c870

His meeting history is missing but it looks like we still have all our emails.

ALSO … The Open Opportunity https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Opportunities/45e39df8-a909-11eb-883a-068897b1c870 

No longer has him tagged to it – Origination Contact is now Marley Bain – who is with a totally different company.

This is quite a serious issue and we hope you look into this asap as apparently something wrong with the sync! Thanks.

Titile: Send emails to 10k people without delay
 Description: Hi Support,

I notice that when I want to send out emails to a large group of recipients (10k+), even though I choose send out immediately, it can take more than 1 hour to process the email and get it sent.

If I create 10 duplicate emails and break down the 10k recipients to small batches (1k), would this make the processing faster so that I can send out my email without much delay?

Many thanks for your help.

Best regards,
Huan

Titile: Sync records when personal email changes to biz email - sugar market/sugar crm
 Description: Hi Support,

 

We have this case where some leads use business email and personal email to register for our webinars (as form now doesn’t have domain suppression function) and then get two records created.

 

Example> https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Contacts/074c3054-7976-11eb-90d1-068897b1c870

https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Leads/0fa237d4-9ebb-11eb-b74a-06de1dcd2532

This guy already exists as a contact in Sugar with his biz email and we prefer all his Sugar Market history (engagement) to be with his biz email

So...  If I update his lead record (Personal Email) to his biz mail, Convert, accept the duplicate and MERGE the two choosing the most current Sugar Market Date, will

The Sugar Market data be reflected in the merge record?
Can I then manually update the score not to be a -number?  (I “can” but at what risk)
Will any activities he signed up for still valid (since the personal will no longer be in Sugar)? E.g. will his record still in the event module and after we refresh attendees, will a new gmail contact be created or the info in invalid and any follow up email involving the gmail will be aborted?
We think it’s best to convert and update these personal email records but not sure what the risk is when we do that.

 

Thank you for your guidance.

 

Best regards,

Huan

Titile: Sugar not using correct currency rates in Reports
 Description: Hi there.

This week we updated our currency rates in CRM and have identified what we think is a serious bug.

When we updated our currency rates all our reports and dashboards also changed. Not just for open opportunities but also for historic closed won opportunities.

As far as I was aware currency rates should be locked for closed won opportunities.

Perhaps the most obvious and easiest example would be this opportunity:

https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Opportunities/5f2c80f6-4444-11eb-94c4-02fdc066b29e

In the Revenue line item and opportunity level the amount is 33,411.25 USD (using the correct locked exchange rate of 0.748251). 

In all reports the opportunity / RLI shows as 29,761.90 USD - ie using the new currency rate we updated this week (0.84).

The field we are using is Likely (RLI) which is what we were told to use.

This is an urgent problem as all our dashboards and reports are out of line with our actual numbers!

Thank you in advance for your help.

And sugar crm is the master, so all the changes made for a record in sugar crm will sync down to sugar market and all changes made in sugar market will be synced to sugar crm?

Form ID 3 in sugar market.

And regarding multi-select field, how does the overwrite data field work?

Say originally submit to Supply chain newsletter, then I open the form, input same email and select shale newsletter, renewables newsletter, should the field in sugar crm be shown as "supply chain newsletter, shale newsletter, renewables newsletter", or  "shale newsletter, renewables newsletter"?

Thank you very much for the check and clarification!

Subject: RE: Sugar Market Support Requests / Reported Bugs
 
Hi Michael,

Thank you very much for the detailed response, regarding (SI 86334) [Sugar Market] SugarCRM sync for Converted Leads, what we meant is that when we sync sugar market user activities to sugar crm, those leads with status “converted” are always changed back to “assigned”. Example below. https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Leads/a44701c0-fe19-11e8-a850-5254004653d4

My account is used for the connector between Sugar CRM and Sugar Market but the change was made by the system. It would be great if you could also investigate this issue further as this causes repetitive manual work for our sales team to keep revising the status.

Understanding that a new sprint starts today, we look forward to hearing more updates from you regarding concerns below.

Thank you and wish you a nice day.

Best regards,

Huan

Titile: Sugar Market missing features in version 21.4
 Description: Hi Support,

Understanding that "For Sugar Market, everyone is on the latest version. When you see new posts in Sugar Club regarding the available version, that means that you are currently on that version."

We still have issues:
1. When a contact's email address is updated in the contact record, the address is not updated in the distribution lists of which the contact is a member.
We tested with example and email is not updated in the distribution list https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#ProspectLists/7aeb3bf2-8567-11eb-ac6f-02fdc066b29e
https://appeu.salesfusion.com/DistributionListEdit.aspx?ListId=677&ReturnUrl=webapp%2F%23%2Fmanage%2Fdistribution%2Fdistribution-lists%3Fview%3Dlist

2. No target list is created in sugar crm for Nurture 1.0 or 2.0 in sugar market
Lori kindly helped with test, and she said that "When I tested the functionality in my sandbox instance, I was able to have target lists created in the CRM for any campaign that I created, NB 1.0 campaign, NB 2.0 campaign, Single Email EMB 1.0 and Single Email EMB 2.0."

Could you please help to check our environment and see what is wrong?

This not only happens for CSV import but also when creating a new case manually in the case module.

Titile: New lead created in sugar crm from sugar market form submission after a lead is marked dead in sugar crm
 Description: Hi support,

We encounter this issue that we keep getting new leads created for those who we marked as dead in sugar crm. 
https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#search/jack%20shi?
I know this is because this person submitted a sugar form thus a new lead is created, could you please help us to understand the lead push process, is this because there is an auto-delete of dead leads in sugar market? or dead leads IDs are not mapped  with the sync. 
Could you please advise how to avoid this from happening? Many thanks.

I added the record John Oliver to 'Sync Test list', his email shows as john.oliver@aol.com. I then found John Oliver in SugarCRM and updated his email to john.oliver@doesthisupdate.com.

 Description: Hi Support,

Could you please help me to understand the sync of distribution lists
1. when does a salesfusion target list in sugar crm is created? is it when an email is sent our from sugar market, or a webinar event is finished in sugar market?
2. are the salesfusion lists in sugar market created because they are synced from the target lists in sugar crm?
3. is the salesfusion target list in sugar crm and the salesfusion distribution list in sugar market dynamic? saying I have an email A sent out from sugar market, using an imported list, then a salesfusion list B is created in sugar crm automatically, if I make any changes in sugar crm of info of some leads or contacts that are included in B, such as change email domain, will the email info of the lead be updated automatically in the B? will this information be also updated in the salesfusion distribution list in sugar market?

a scenario, I sent out an email including amy@abc.com this morning, then I edit Amy's email to amy@cba.com, in the salesfusion list in crm and market, will Amy's address changes to amy@cba.com automatically?

Thanks for clarification!

Titile: Webinar information sync between Sugar Market and Sugar CRM issue
 Description: Hi Support, 

Could you please help me to understand how the webinar registration sync between sugar market and sugar crm works.
This lead was created: https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Leads/fa1ad526-51b0-11eb-b57f-06de1dcd2532 for the webinar event ID 25 and 26 (Monthly Covid-19 webinar), I set refresh attended 2 hours after the webinar finish. In Gotowebinar (Gtw), this person is not approved yet. 

My question is: 
Does the connection between sugar market and gotowebinar work in both ways or just one way to push info from Sugar Market registration form to Gtw?

What I learned from Sugar onboarding training was that the attendee information will be synced from Gtw at the time "Refresh Attended" that is specified in the Session Edit section under the Event module and leads are created in Sugar CRM thereafter. 

For those that we deny registration in Gtw, how willsugar market handle them? 

In the example above, that lead is unwanted as he registered with his personal email address and I will delete him in Gtw. But as this lead was already created in Sugar CRM, will it be possible to automatically remove the lead in Sugar CRM once I change attendee status to Registration Rejected at the Event Management module? If not, how would you suggest us to handle this situation? As our sales get very confused why some unqualified leads are sent from Sugar Market and this also takes them extra time to clean up these leads in crm.

Thank you for your help!

Sugar market form Free Solutions Registration Form - connector, id 27

Two questions:
Can this sugar market form still capture cookies and track user activities with the connector?
When will info in the external form be copied to sugar market form? when a person fill in information? when a person submitted the form? after a period of time after the person submitted the form? if so, how long is the gap?
How will the leads be pushed to Sugar CRM? - is that for existing leads in crm form, only additional information given the field mapped correctly be synced to sugar crm? - when will new leads be created in crm? is that per 20 mins? 

Another question, as I understand that all fields should be matched in the sugar market form and the external form, but there are some fields are not mapped to crm, should I just skip these fields in the external form creator step 4 map columns? 

Many thanks for your help!

I have uploaded a file to the asset library and updated the link in on of our forms so that after submitting the form, access to the uploaded file should be granted.

 

For some reason it is not working in Google Chrome and it still redirects me to the old file after submitting the form. When I try it in a different browser it all works fine.

 

Has this something to do with the fact that in my “regular” browser all my data in the form is already prefilled ? If yes all the people that have filled out the form once before will run into the same problem.

 

Can you help?

Titile: sugar market lead push to sugar crm
 Description: Hi support,

Could you please help me to understand how a new lead is identified and pushed to sugar crm. As you can see below this example, the lead is created due to the december covid-19 webinar invite but with the same email address, there is already a lead exist in crm that is created in 2019. 
Jerry Kurinsky:
 
Lead created 12/9/2020
https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Leads/546add98-3a2b-11eb-8802-068897b1c870.
 
Lead Created 9/23/2019
https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/#Leads/ce742d7a-de0f-11e9-a9c8-52540006f300


Could you please advise, as many duplicates will double our lead manager's workload and will provide a biased view of lead generation. Many thanks!

Best,

Also, I tried to pull a list from the newsletter that I sent out last month, I choose from campaign but how can I include the all people that received the supply chain newsletter November?

 Description: Hi Support,

A question regarding competitor suppression list, I understand that the suppressed domain can technically submit the form but all the criteria set on the suppression list will be respected, i.e. no email sent, no scoring etc.

But I tested it with webinar registration, I see registration with competitor’s domain (ihs.com for example) can still synced to GoToWebinar.

May I ask how to avoid this from happening?

Many thanks!

I’m a Sugar Market user through an account for Rystad Energy and today I can’t get anything to load and when I try to create or manage campaigns, my only option is emails (no forms, landing pages, nurture campaigns, etc anymore). Is this a wider issue people are experiencing or is there something wrong with my profile?

 

This is greatly impacting me doing my job so hoping to get a resolution sooner rather than later.

I'm having a repeated issue with Revenue Line items.

THe issue is quite often the RLI does not have TEAM GLOBAL as default. 

There have been many many examples of this and i thought originally this is because people were removing the global part, but after it happen too repeatedly I realized it can't be.

This is one example when it happened. I've changed it back already. 

https://rystadenergy.sugaropencloud.eu/index.php#RevenueLineItems/c2c1106f-9bfd-4e9c-9e60-acf94715dcf0

The problem is when it's not global most people in the company cant see it. How can we ensure all RLIs are global by default?

So it should basically count the amount of people landing on the PR page as a conversion but unfortunately it doesn’t show any conversion yet even though 82 people clicked on the link within the post which basically means they landed on the page.

In the form the question is a checkbox which maps the same value back to CRM. I see the form submission data ok but the preference options selected are not mapping into CRM. This could be due to the type of field the customer is using in CRM. The field in Market is a text field.

Please investigate as this customer is very very eager to find a solution.

Titile: Undefined leads
 Description: Dear Sugar-support team,

I’m experiencing that the majority of our leads in the month of March show as undefined

When I’m doing spot checks on the entries behind I see that they do have a campaign defined, see an example below


Do you know why they still show as undefined and how I can correct this? I did re-assign the campaign manually in one of the entries and saved, but it would still show as undefined.

Where shall I start to dig in?

 

Thanks much in advance.

Best regards,

Anna-Maria

Titile: Continues from Case 289813
 Description: In Case "288956" I submitted some info, though the case was closed before I had the time to update. So I am submitting a new in relation to that one.
It is two areas that causes problem, and here is an update and contact information to the Customer Contact so you can follow up directly with him.

Answer to questions in previous case 288956:

1. Conflict - handling: I am not sure what the reason was to why it stoped working, but I believe it was an update of the plugin.

2. When we got the issues we used the -> Right Click on the Calendar entry in Outlook and chose "Mark to Sync"
Then we went to "Home" in Outlook and chose "Sync to Sugar"

Please contact the customer directly to follow up on this as he can show you directly how this breaks:

Can I add Contacts/Leads into a TargetList via the ExcelAddIn?

I know it's possible using the API (set_relationship - like shown in the below link), but I am wondering if it is possible to do it via Excel.

Titile: Contacts search is failed - 2
 Description: Thanks for the update.
We have installed the latest AddIn version, but it seems to have some issues as well.

One of our users says:
"To me, the new plugin has only added issues rather than removing them.

When I try to archive emails now, the automatic search for the email address actually fails (see below). I can delete the whole search string and then “Search” again – then it works. Seems like it doesn’t tolerate “@” in the search field."

Please see attached file with the error message.

Titile: Unable to change the from email of a Marketing email
 Description: Hi,

In the campaign module, when I create a marketing email, if I use the default configured email account (SugarCRM@rystadenergy.com), I have the possibility to change the ‘From Name’ and the ‘From Address’. In the example below I changed it to my name and email. I changed as well the reply to fields.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwuyTDOhTzOjR2s0QXdmQVlBZHM/view?usp=sharing


And after I send the test marketing email, I get the email below, which is from SugarCRM and not Hugo Passos, as I want. However when I press reply, it popup my email address, which is correct according to the marketing email settings.
So my question is: do you know how can I the correct from address in the email sent?

Titile: Issues while sharing a report
 Description: Hi,
 
I am facing an issue that seems to be a bug. If I go to the email module and compose an email, I am able to send it. But if I go to a report and I select “Share” and then I input the same “to” email address I am not able to send the email, because I get the message:

Error Could not connect to the email server. Please make sure that email configuration has been setup correctly.
 
However, if instead of select “Share” I select “Save as Draft” and then I go to the emails module, select the saved email and just press “Send” it works!
Are you aware of this? Am I doing anything wrong here?
 
Thanks,
Hugo
